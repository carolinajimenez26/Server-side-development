the framework [express](http://expressjs.com/).

It consists of differents examples:

*server-1.js:*

Server constructed from scratch, it displays _Hello World_

*server-2.js:*

More elaborated server constructed from scratch which render html pages if exists, and
sends HTTP answers if it doesn't.

*server-3.js:*

Server constructed with _express_. It shows a _Hello World_ messege.

It is a improve of server-5.js using the Router object.
